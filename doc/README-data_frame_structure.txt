Final dataframe structure
- columns are in alphabetical order by name
- eventually they will be reordered e.g. according to Rovero and Zimmermann 2016
- if need be, further columns can be added, be consistent with column naming
- each row contains: the field name, the R field mode, a concise description of the semantics, the source of data.
The basic structure described below is defined in base_functions.R, finction .createEmptyCatalog.

  - Camera.End.Date.and.Time: character(); when a camera finished operating (timestamp); from metadata file in camera directory
  - Camera.Manufacturer: character(); camera manufacturer;  from metadata file in camera directory
